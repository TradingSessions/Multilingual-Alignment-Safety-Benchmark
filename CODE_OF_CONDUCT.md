# Code of Conduct

## üåü Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment for AI safety research, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the MASB-Alt project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## üìã Our Standards

### Positive Behavior Examples

- Include diverse voices in decision-making processes
- Test features with speakers from relevant language communities

### Ethical AI Development
- Consider the potential impact of AI systems on marginalized communities
- Develop safeguards against cultural bias in evaluation metrics
- Promote AI safety research that benefits all communities equally
- Be transparent about limitations and potential biases in the system

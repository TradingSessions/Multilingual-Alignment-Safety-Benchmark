### 3. Code Contributions

#### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/masb-alt/masb-alt.git
cd masb-alt

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run system validation
python system_validation.py

# Run tests
pytest tests/
```

#### Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
3. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
4. **Write or update tests** for your changes
5. **Run the test suite** to ensure nothing breaks
6. **Update documentation** as needed
7. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

#### Coding Standards

- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations for all functions
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for all public methods
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling
- **Logging**: Use the project's logging configuration
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for new functionality

#### Code Review Process

1. All submissions require review before merging
2. Reviewers will check for:
   - Code quality and standards compliance
   - Test coverage and functionality
   - Documentation completeness
   - Cultural sensitivity (for language-related changes)
   - Performance implications
   - Security considerations

## üåç Language and Cultural Contributions

Given our focus on underrepresented languages, we especially value:

### Language Expertise
- Native speakers who can validate cultural appropriateness
- Linguists who understand language-specific nuances
- Cultural experts who can advise on sensitive topics

### Translation and Localization
- Prompt translations that maintain semantic meaning
- Cultural adaptation of evaluation criteria
- Documentation translation for accessibility

### Evaluation Improvements
- Domain-specific evaluation criteria
- Cultural sensitivity assessments
- Risk detection patterns for specific languages

## üìä Research Contributions

We welcome research-oriented contributions:

### Data and Datasets
- High-quality multilingual evaluation datasets
- Cultural sensitivity annotations
- Benchmark comparisons with other systems

### Methodology Improvements
- Enhanced evaluation metrics
- Statistical analysis methods
- Bias detection algorithms

### Publications and Documentation
- Research papers using MASB-Alt
- Case studies and best practices
- Tutorial content and examples

## üîß Technical Priorities

Current areas where contributions are most needed:

### High Priority
- Support for additional languages (especially African and Asian languages)
- Enhanced cultural sensitivity detection
- Performance optimizations for large-scale evaluation
- Integration with more LLM providers

### Medium Priority
- Advanced visualization features
- Multi-tenant deployment capabilities
- Enhanced reporting formats
- API rate limiting and caching

### Low Priority
- UI/UX improvements for the dashboard
- Additional export formats
- Integration with external tools
- Performance profiling tools

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Pull Request Requirements

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests pass (run `pytest tests/`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated (for significant changes)
- [ ] Cultural sensitivity is considered (for language-related changes)
- [ ] No breaking changes without discussion

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(evaluation): add cultural sensitivity scoring`
- `fix(api): resolve async timeout issue`
